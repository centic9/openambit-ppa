OPENAMBIT
=========

The openambit source repository consists of several parts.
Each part is briefly described below.
Most people would like to use both the device communication
library (libambit) and the GUI (openambit). The build / install
scripts described below make your life easier if you are
like most people.
You can choose to run the GUI from the build folder or install
it to your system.

BUILD SCRIPT
============
Builds libambit and openambit in one command
> cd YOUR/git/REPO/location
> ./build.sh


BUILD AND INSTALL SCRIPT
========================
Builds and install libambit and openambit in one command.
Note that the script will try to run sudo to install things.
> cd YOUR/git/REPO/location
> ./install.sh


DEPENDENCIES
============
To be able to build libambit and openambit the following libraries
(and their header files) need to be available:
 - libudev
 - libusb
 - libqjson

For debian-based systems:
> sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libqjson-dev


src/libambit
============
The "driver" library as a shared object. Written in C.

Build instructions:
> mkdir libambit-build
> cd libambit-build
> cmake ../src/libambit
> make
Optionally:
> sudo make install


src/openambit
=============
The GUI application. Uses the libambit library.

Build instructions:
First build libambit as instructed above
> mkdir openambit-build
> cd openambit-build
> cmake ../src/openambit
> make
Optionally:
> sudo make install

Run the application without installing:
> cd openambit-build
> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../libambit-build ./openambit


tools/movescountXmlDiff.pl
==========================
Small Perl-script to compare XML-files generated by
openambit and Suuntos Moveslink. Basically a diff with
added floating point round errors ignored.


wireshark_dissector
===================
To ease the parsing of the protocol a wireshark dissector
is maintained. This dissector parses pcap-files made with
usbpcap. The parts of the protocol that is known atm
should be present in the latest dissector.

Build instructions:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> cp ambit.so ~/.wireshark/plugins
